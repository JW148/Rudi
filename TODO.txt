Rudi's TODO

 - Rearrange the Till menu 
   - make it easier to navigate (by colour coordinating, changing layout)
   - change buttons to 'pressable opacity' (for more customisation)
   - make cash or card option (cash option opens another component that you can select the cash amount they've given (£5, £10, £20, £50, etc) 
     and also record in the sale data whether it was a cash or card payment)
   - every time an item is selected, display next to it how many times it has been selected (counter)
  
 - make button component for better encapsulation (reduce code repitition)

 - make connected to server indicator (small green dot in the top right of the screen
   which indicates it's connected - red if not)

 - make edit item component (once an item has been recorded to the database, the
   user should have the ability to edit that item)

 - record number of each bread every morning 
   - either with manual input or 
   - have the ability to be able to take a picture of the bread order form
     and from that image the app should read the the name of each bread and it's amount

 - use moment.js for date/time functionality

 - Sales component
   - displays current days and previous days sale data
   - at the top of the component, there will be a horizontal scrolling date picker
