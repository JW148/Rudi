Rudi's TODO

 - Rearrange the Till menu
   - make it easier to navigate (by colour coordinating, changing layout)
   - change buttons to 'pressable opacity' (for more customisation)
   - make cash or card option (cash option opens another component that you can select the cash amount they've given (£5, £10, £20, £50, etc) 
     and also record in the sale data whether it was a cash or card payment)
  
 - make button component for better encapsulation (reduce code repitition)
